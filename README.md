The goal of the project I've made is to build a binaryclassification model that uses lifestyle parameters to predict the risk of liver disease. 
I preprocess a data set with lifestyle variables like alcohol intake, smoking status, and BMI using Python.
By carefully choosing features and evaluating KNN, logistic regression, and SVM models. I determine which
predictor is accurate.
